3) Then download the latest version of [CabbageScape](https://github.com/cabbagegod/cabbagescape/releases). *Keep in mind, you will only need the .jar file*
4) Finally, put CabbageScape and the Fabric API into your mods folder, which you can find inside your .minecraft. *If there is no "mods" folder, simply create one.*

Now you're ready to enjoy all the awesome perks of CabbageScape! Make sure you select the Fabric Loader inside your minecraft launcher when starting up the game!
